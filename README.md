# Rotaract Event Tracker

This is a small utility meant for tracking the amount of time each member of a Rotaract Club spends doing events and socials in a year. It is generalised, so it doesn't need to be for a Rotaract club specifically, that's just what I'm using it for.

IMPORTANT:
This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Rotary or Rotaract in any way.
